Dev Notes
=========

I need to try and make sense of the spec, so im going to vomit info
into this file

Lets try and split this into:

    * production

    * group actions



Defaults
========
I had to pick some defaults for some of the settings...


Industry - Goods and Food
Privileged Cohort - Size: medium, Liberty: , QoL: , Cash: high
Servitor Cohort - Size: large, Liberty: , QoL: , Cash:.

  Privileged(size=Game.MED, liberty=Game.MED,
             quality_of_life=Game.HIGH, cash=Game.HIGH),
  Servitor(size=Game.MAX, liberty=Game.LOW,
             quality_of_life=Game.LOW, cash=Game.MED)



Military - Force and Stability
Privileged Cohort - Size: small, Liberty: , QoL: , Cash:.
Servitor/Warrior Cohort - Size: medium, Liberty: , QoL: , Cash:.

  Privileged(size=Game.LOW, liberty=Game.HIGH,
             quality_of_life=Game.HIGH, cash=Game.HIGH),
  Servitor(size=Game.MED, liberty=Game.HIGH,
             quality_of_life=Game.MED, cash=Game.MED)



Logistics - Transport to and from Planet
Privileged Cohort - Size: medium, Liberty: , QoL: , Cash:.
Servitor Cohort - Size: small, Liberty: , QoL: , Cash:.

  Privileged(size=Game.MED, liberty=Game.HIGH,
             quality_of_life=Game.HIGH, cash=Game.HIGH),
  Servitor(size=Game.LOW, liberty=Game.MED,
             quality_of_life=Game.HIGH, cash=Game.MED)






Production: what we know
========================
factions consume resources

zones produce resources depending on cohort.willingness and efficiency

zones convert raw into resources

resources requirements must be met or a drop off in output
MEANS - output depends on having enough of all inputs, less of an input
reduces the possible amount of output.

  * list requirements -what we need, how much
  * list provided - what are created from what vol of inputs

cohorts require Goods or their Quality of Life decreases temporarily (in turn
affecting efficiency or willingness, at least)
cohort size affects how much Goods they need
cohort Quality of Life affects Goods needed as well (to a lesser extent)

servitor cohorts create zone resource using willingness
privileged cohorts assist creation using efficiency

NOTES - willingness is more important ie servitors do most of the work, but
the efficiency has to have some effect



We want the initial setup to work, and likely create extra resources
We can do that by adjusting the production formula for each zone, tweaking
the requirements and what is produced from that volume of inputs...



efficiency can be increased by plan


Industry - Goods and Food
  Processing done by huge Servitor Cohort
  Staffed by Privileged Cohort
  Requires Enforcement (military)
  Requires Raw Materials (logistics)
  **Requires Goods (Industry == self!)
  Provides Goods -> support all Cohorts in all zones

Military - Force and Stability
  Run by Privileged Cohort
  Staffed by Servitor/Warrior Cohort (harder to infiltrate than others)
  **Requires Goods (economic)
  Requires Manpower (logistics)
  Provides Enforcement

Logistics - Transport to and from Planet
  Staffed by Privileged Cohort
  Supported by small Servitor Cohort
  **Requires Goods (economic)
  Requires Enforcement (military)
  Provides Raw Material from planet
  Provides Manpower from planet


quality of life   <-- goods
liberty <-- faction plan setting
cash  <-- constant

Production method is:
  turn N:  produce into zone stock
  turn N+1: ship out to other zones from local stocks
  turn N+2: used in other zone
This is one by performing the following steps each turn:
  * consume <things> in prep for production
  * transport last turns <things> to a new destination
  * produce <things> (based on consume availaibilty )
